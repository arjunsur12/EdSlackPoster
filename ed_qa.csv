,,Ed Guidelines & Ediquette,"Important: Ed Guidelines &amp; EdiquetteWelcome everyone!We’re excited to be your TAs this semester and hope you all are ready for a fun ride. We use Ed because it’s an incredibly valuable resource for students (ask questions, send updates/notices, etc.). In order to make Ed as efficient and effective as possible, we ask that you please follow these guidelines:BEFORE POSTING1. SEARCH BEFORE POSTINGBefore posting, please try to find if there are already similar Ed posts by searching one or two keywords related to your question and looking through our FAQ documents.2. Use other resources (lectures, textbook, other Ed posts, etc…) available to you before making a post on EdBefore you post on Ed, please take some time to attempt to debug and fully understand your problem. Using the resources and debugging techniques you have learned in office hours or recitation may allow you to answer your own question or make it easier for us to help you.DRAFTING POSTS3. DO NOT POST YOUR CODE PUBLICLYYou should never share your own code publicly. In general, try to refrain from posting code unless necessary. When appropriate, a TA may ask you to share your code privately to help answer your question(s).4. Format code using Ed’s code block formatFor readability purposes, if you are including code in a post please use the code block format (denoted by {;} symbol in the toolbar above the textbox). It should look like the following:let s : string = ""Hello, World!"" ;; print_endline(s) If the code is too long, feel free to attach a screenshot of your code complete with line numbers (make sure it is only visible to instructors).5. Use the folders!When making a post, organize it into the appropriate folder. This will help TAs and other students find your posts, and helps to keep things organized between assignments and exams.6. Be respectfulWe want everyone to have a great time in CIS1200 so please be respectful to course staff and your fellow classmates! Disrespectful posts will not be tolerated!AFTER POSTING7. Marking follow-ups as “unresolved”If you post a question and decide later that you have a follow-up question, you can either edit your original post (only if you have not yet received a response) or post a followup question in the followup discussion section below your post.Please do not answer your own question with your followup question because this marks your question as resolved and the TAs will likely miss your question 😦. On that note, if you post in the followup discussion section, do not forget to mark this discussion thread as unresolved!8. Gradescope and the TAs are not your debugger.We cannot help with failing Gradescope tests without a failing test of your own. When you submit homework on Gradescope, you will be given the name of the first failing test only. We cannot help you interpret the name or what it’s testing for, and we cannot tell you any information beyond that about other failing tests. If you fail a test on Gradescope, you will need to write your own tests for it before posting on Ed or coming to OH.9. Help your classmates!If you see a question and think you can answer it, please do! This’ll help you learn the material as well!As always, please be respectful to your fellow classmates and CIS1200 staff. If you have any additional questions, feel free to let us know!Happy coding!",,,General,,
,,Office Hours Guidelines and Etiquette,"Important: Office Hours Guidelines &amp; EtiquetteOffice hours will start on Tuesday, September 2nd. Office hours for CIS1200 are often busy, so we publish these guidelines for TA office hours to ensure you are helped equitably and efficiently. TA office hours are in-person and you will use OHQ to join the queue in order to be helped.GuidelinesOffice hours are for conceptual and debugging help. Explain to your TA what you have already reviewed in terms of content or tried in terms of debugging. If you haven’t reviewed the lecture content or tried thoroughly debugging on your own, you’re not ready for additional help.Prepare for office hours. TAs will aim to spend five to ten minutes with you, so maximize the help you get by having clear questions prepared.If you do have a tough bug, your TA might ask other TAs to help debug or ask you to post on Ed. However, asking more TAs to help means longer wait times on the queue. Be respectful of your fellow students’ time by having a clear and specific question in mind for your TA!If you encounter an unfamiliar bug, search Ed for related keywords. You will save yourself a lot of time spent debugging and waiting on the queue!As seen in the Ed guidelines, the TAs and Gradescope are not your debugger. If you fail a test on Gradescope, you must write your own failing test for a TA to be able to help you with your code.Recommendations and What to ExpectYou may already be familiar with OHQ, but here are some tips to ensure that everything goes smoothly and efficiently:Have a clear and specific question ready. Consider keeping a list of the things that you want to talk about with a TA.Continue to attempt to debug while you are in the queue. Sometimes students can find the bug before the TA gets to them!Here is what you should do when you’re with a TA:Describe your bug and the steps taken to produce it, or describe your conceptual question.Explain what you think the problem is and what steps you have taken to solve it. Do not simply say that something doesn’t work. We are here to help you learn how to debug effectively and think like a programmer – not to do your assignment.Here is what to expect when the office hours queue gets long:Your TA may pass your question along to other TAs if it takes more than 10-15 minutes to help debug (this shouldn’t be the case if your question is clear and specific).When the queue is busy, we may enforce limits on how often students can ask questions in the queue. This prevents small numbers of students from occupying office hours at the exclusion of everyone else.We will clear the queue (remove any remaining questions from the queue) when scheduled office hours end.Looking forward to meeting many of you at office hours!",,,General,,

,,Encapsulation,"Hi, I'm wondering if you have suggestions on how to remove swing from my game state class. I'm creating a typing game, and my game state class is called racetrack. This class is where I create objects that represent the player and the bot, and change their velocity, etc. I was using a keylistener to listen for what keys the user is typing and checking to see if the key they just typed is equal to the next character in my arraylist of characters:I'm also using a timer that goes off every few milliseconds and calls the tick() method to update the position of the bot and the player during the game:","Ok, so to start - your model (RaceTrack) should not know anything about Swing. No Timers, KeyListeners, repaint, etc. Your model should expose simple methods that can be called by the controller, such as handleKeyPress(), tick(), isWinner(), etc. These are the methods that update positions/velocities and other game-state related stuff based on the current state. The UI view should handle key events / timer and call the model's functions with the relevant data as input. For example, a key listener in the UI view should parse the keypress or the position of the mouse click on the screen into data that can be passed into a move() function. (Ex: if your character could move left and right only, you could parse the keypress and have an if-else statement that calls move(String direction) with ""LEFT "" for ""A"" and ""RIGHT"" for ""D"". The keypress isn't exposed to the model, but you derive what it means before passing it in. These are just examples. So I would start by making another file and carefully separating the two functions. One file for the model (doesn't interact with Swing at all) and one file for the UI (calls the model functions based on user input).","Ok, so to start - your model (RaceTrack) should not know anything about Swing.

,,Tail Recursion,"Why isn't this tail recursive from this semester's fall 25 midterm 2. My understanding of the concept is that as long as we don't need to ""add something"" or do an operation after we run the recursive call(i.e. 1+ mystery (x-1) is immediately not tail recursive or f mystery (x-1) where f is a function wouldn't be tail recursive).

I like thinking of it as you do, I also sometimes imagine it as traveling down the recursive calls and whether or not we know the answer of the initial call by the time we reach the base case or not.

,,Fall 25 - Q6.7,Is the ans key not 100% correct in that the next() method needs to have a declaration:next() throws NoSuchElementException(){},"First, when it comes to differentiating those exceptions, best recommendation is when studying to look over the main exceptions you've dealt with and pay attention to whether or not they are checked or unchecked (which mostly means checking if they are RuntimeExceptions or not) (this is another thing your cheat sheet could be helpful for). There really isn't a great way to differentiate unless it is told to you or you memorize them.For the second part, you have the correct premise yes, but you can recover from a FileNotFound exception.

It occurs to me that NoSuchElementException is a runtime exception -- is there any advice for differentiating exceptions from checked vs unchecked that's not on the tree?And as a further question, the entire premise of differentiating between declared &amp; undeclared exceptions is that there are certain ones we can 'recover' from w/ try...catch...However, I think I'm not understanding this properly -- the IO Exception or FileNotFound, there's no real way to recover from them, right?",Exams,,
